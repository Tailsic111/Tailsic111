NSFW (It just don't make me feel comfortable for obvious reasons)

Cycba (She literally went Ms. Manipulative mode and committed a pseudocide, she also did bad things and "apologized" until she got caught)

Theoyeah (or any hypocrite in general)

Most of all, Luke242014. Luke, if you're reading this, go touch some grass, threatening to get my Scratch account banned does not do anything, it only makes you a bad person.

Also, I feel really uncomfortable using my actual OC (if you can even call a yellow sonic recolor with blue stripes original) because it looks terrible so I just use a jokish version. Also I have a bambisona that I never used named Bambux. I wish I used him more often.
